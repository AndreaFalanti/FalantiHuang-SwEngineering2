The installation of the software consists in the single step of installing the apk on an android device, which it's a really simple step. No other instructions are provided, as the system is already online and therefore there is no need of running the server locally. Anyway a short guide for local installation could have been nice, also because there is no way to install the client on iOS without building directly the client with XCode, without instructions we couldn't test the application on iPhone unfortunately.
