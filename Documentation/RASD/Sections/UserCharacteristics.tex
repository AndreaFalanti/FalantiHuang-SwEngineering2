The actors of the system are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Citizen}: a common citizen without any public office, who registers to report violations and mine traffic violation data from the application data storage in order to identify and avoid the most 	 areas and streets of a city.
	\item\textbf{Authorities}: the public officials who will receive the validated reports from the report supervisor of SafeStreets and confirm them, and will also mine data with a direct access to private information(license plate) of the transgressors.
	\item \textbf{Municipality}: the institution that provides traffic violation data to SafeStreets and expects to get intervention suggestions in return.
\end{enumerate}
