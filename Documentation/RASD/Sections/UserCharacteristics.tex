The actors of the system are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Citizen}: a common user without any public office, who registers to report violations and mine traffic violation data from the application data storage in order to identify and avoid the most unsafe areas and streets of a city.
	\item\textbf{Authorities}: the public officials who will receive the reports from SafeStreets and have the possibility to validate or invalidate them. They could also mine data with a direct access to private information(license plate) of the transgressors.
	\item \textbf{Municipality}: an institution that provides traffic violation data to SafeStreets and expects to get intervention suggestions in return.
\end{enumerate}
