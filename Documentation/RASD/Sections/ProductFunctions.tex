In the following sections the most important functions of the application are presented. The service of intervention suggestions to the municipalities is built on top of the storage data obtained by the reports from the citizens and optionally integrated with additional violation data provided by municipalities themselves.
\subsubsection{Violation Report}
This product function is the main feature of the system. After the user has signed up with an e-mail and a password, the user will be able to take a photos of the violation and upload it on the application, providing its violation type and optionally a description. The coordinates of the violation will be automatically determined using the GPS service of the user's device and filled in the report. After that, the user will be able to check the status of his/her report. The system also allows the registered users to mine data from its data storage with different levels of authorization in order to protect the privacy of the individuals and avoid a misuse of the data from the common citizens.
\subsubsection{Intervention Suggestion}
This product function is offered when a municipality provides its own data about traffic accidents on its territory. After the municipality has signed up and provided the API to access its data, SafeStreets will cross its own data gathered from the validated reports, find the possible interventions for the most afflicted areas of the territory and notify the municipality. Then, the municipality can log in and check the suggested interventions up to that time.

Because no standards are defined about violations' data cataloging, it would be too complex and time consuming for SafeStreets to build an interface to cross data with each municipality registered to the system that use a different data structure for storing violations. Because of this consideration, for using this functionality the municipality is responsible for complying to the conventions used by SafeStreets, that will be provided and accurately explained in the website page relative to the service.
