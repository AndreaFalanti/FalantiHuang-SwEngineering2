In this section project requirements are presented and relationships between goals, domain assumptions and requirements are clearly stated, to provide a logical representation of the model analysis.

\bigskip
Requirements:
\begin{enumerate}[label={R\arabic*.}]
	\myitem {When a traffic violation is reported, the report supervisor has to verify it and then notify the authorities.} \label{R_supervisor}
	\myitem {Reports about traffic violations need to be stored in a database, also associating them to the user profile who sent them.} \label{R_storing_report}
	\myitem {The system needs to integrate reported traffic violations with data from the municipality and analyse all the data with an algorithm to find possible interventions to address the detected main cause of the violations.} \label{R_mun_integration}
	\myitem {The suggestions about interventions must be sent to the municipality to evaluate a possible solution.} \label{R_mun_intervention_send}
	\myitem {Traffic violations data must be available for public consultation with different levels of visibility, according to user's level of authorisation.} \label{R_data_vis}
	\begin{enumerate}[label={R\arabic{enumi}.\arabic*.}]
		\myitem {The system should allow a normal user to access only to aggregated data, without the license plate of the reported vehicle or the personal info of the user who reported the violation.} \label{R_data_vis_cit}
		\myitem {The system should allow the authorities to access the data without any limitation.} \label{R_data_vis_auth}
	\end{enumerate}
	\myitem {An operator must ascertain the identity of authorities that want to register to the system.} \label{R_auth_certification}
	\myitem {The system must receive correctly reports about the various traffic violations from the users.} \label{R_report_reception}
	\myitem {A violation report must have a photo attached that clearly shows the license plate and the type of violation.} \label{R_photo} 
\end{enumerate}

Goal Logical Derivation:
\begin{enumerate}[label={G\arabic*.}]
	\item Report certified traffic violations to authorities.
	\begin{itemize}[label={}]
		\item \nameref{R_supervisor}.
		\item \nameref{R_auth_certification}.
		\item \nameref{R_report_reception}.
		\item \nameref{D_reports}.
		\item \nameref{D_supervisor}.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Store data about violations and cross it with municipality's ones to identify possible interventions.
	\begin{itemize}[label={}]
		\item \nameref{R_storing_report}.
	 	\item \nameref{R_mun_integration}.
	 	\item \nameref{R_mun_intervention_send}.
	 	\item \nameref{D_mun_availability}.
	 	\item \nameref{D_mun_accuracy}.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Provide a synthesis of all the violations' data to users, based on their authorisation level.
	\begin{itemize}[label={}]
		\item \nameref{R_data_vis}.
		\item \nameref{D_internet}.(may need to be specified more clearly).
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{enumerate}[label={G\arabic{enumi}.\arabic*.}]
		\item Normal users can access only to aggregated data, without seeing any private info about a reported violation, like the license plate or the personal info of the user who reported the violation.
		\begin{itemize}[label={}]
			\item \nameref{R_data_vis_cit}.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Authenticated authorities can access to all violations' data.
		\begin{itemize}[label={}]
			\item \nameref{R_data_vis_auth}.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Allow users to send a report of a possible traffic violation.
	\begin{itemize}[label={}]
		\item \nameref{R_report_reception}.
		\item \nameref{R_photo}.
		\item \nameref{D_gps}.
		\item \nameref{D_internet}. 
	\end{itemize}
	\item Allow users to check their personal info and the list of violations they reported.
	\begin{itemize}[label={}]
		\item \nameref{R_storing_report}.
		\item \nameref{D_internet}.
	\end{itemize} 
\end{enumerate}
