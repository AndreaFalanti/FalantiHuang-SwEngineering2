\paragraph{Scenarios}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Johnny is a model citizen of Milan and he is really caring about parking violations, because they are really frequent in his neighbourhood. When he see a violation, he opens the SafeStreets app on his smartphone and reports it with just few clicks. All he needs to do is to take a photo of the violation where the license plate is clearly visible and confirm if the system detected it correctly or not, if not he inserts the license plate manually in the field that appears after the confirmation. Position is automatically detected from the GPS because he allowed the app to access it, and to send the report to SafeStreets he just needs to confirm by clicking the done button.
        
        \item Giuseppe is a veteran user of SafeStreets app, registered to the system since its beginning. One day he need to update his e-mail, because he has no more access to the one he registered with, so he opens the app and check his account tab. Here, he clicks on update e-mail and inserts the new one, then he logs in the e-mail service to confirm the change.
