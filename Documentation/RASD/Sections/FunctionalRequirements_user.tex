\paragraph{Scenarios}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Johnny is a model citizen of Milan and he is really caring about parking violations, because they are really frequent in his neighbourhood. When he sees a violation, he opens the SafeStreets app on his smartphone and reports it with just few clicks. All he needs to do is to take a photo of the violation where the license plate is clearly visible and confirm if the system detected it correctly or not, if not he inserts the license plate manually in the field that appears after the confirmation. Position is automatically detected from the GPS because he allowed the app to access it. Finally, to send the report to SafeStreets he just needs to confirm by clicking the done button.
        
        \item Giuseppe is a righteous citizen and recently has heard about SafeStreets but never used it. One day, he finds a double-parked car right in front of his, so he is not able to get his car out. After waiting some minutes hoping for the owner of the double-parked car to arrive without success, Giuseppe remembers about SafeStreets and decides to use it for the first time. He registers and logs in the app, then he uploads a photo of the car of the transgressor and sends the report. While still waiting, he checks whether his report has been validated by some authorities and sees that after 10 minutes it has been validated, so he now knows that the authorities will take action about it.
        
        \item George is a tourist who has just arrived in Rome, and plans to stay there for a week. When he goes out touring the city with the car he rented for the entire week, he uses SafeStreets to check where the most violation afflicted areas of the city are to avoid areas which can lead to a terrible experience in parking his vehicle. So he opens the SafeStreets app and enters the analyze data tab, selecting Rome as the city and a year time as time interval. George now knows where he should park his car and can have a great experience in Rome.
