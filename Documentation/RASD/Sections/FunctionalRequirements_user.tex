\paragraph{Scenarios}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Johnny is a model citizen of Milan and he is really caring about parking violations, because they are really recurrent in his neighbourhood. When he see a violation, he open the SafeStreets app on his smartphone and report it with just few clicks. All he needs to do is to take a photo of the violation where the licence plate is clearly visible and confirm if the system detected it correctly or not, if not he insert the licence plate manually in the field that appears after the confirmation. Position is automatically detected from the GPS because he allowed the app to access it, and to send the report to SafeStreets he just need to confirm by clicking the done button.
    \end{enumerate}
