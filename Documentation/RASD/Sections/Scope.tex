Goals:
\begin{enumerate}[label={G\arabic*.}]
    \item Report certified traffic violations to authorities.
    \item Store data about violations and cross it with municipality's ones to identify possible interventions.
    \item Provide a synthesis of all the violations' data to users, based on their authorization level.
    \begin{enumerate}[label={G\arabic{enumi}.\arabic*.}]
    	\item Normal users can access only to aggregated data, without seeing any private info about a reported violation, like the license plate or the personal info of the user who reported the violation.
    	\item Authenticated authorities can access to all violations' data.
    \end{enumerate}
	\item Allow users to send a report of a possible traffic violation.
	\item Allow users to check their personal info and the list of violations they reported.
\end{enumerate}
Domain assumptions:
\begin{enumerate}[label={D\arabic*.}]
	\item Registered emails must be unique.
    \item Users report violations when they detect them.
    \item Traffic violations must occur regularly.
    \item Municipality service about accidents is always available.
   	\item Municipality accidents' data is always accurate.
    \item Report supervisor always validates the correctness of the reports.
    \item The GPS sensor of a user's device has an error of at most 5m from the real position.
    \item The internet connection is always available when the user interacts with the system. (may need to be specified more clearly).
\end{enumerate}
Requirements:
\begin{enumerate}[label={R\arabic*.}]
    \item When a traffic violation is reported, the report supervisor verifies it and then notifies the authorities (SE1, DP4, SE3, G1)
    \item Reported traffic violations are stored, integrated with data from the municipality and analysed by an algorithm to find possible interventions to address the detected main cause of the violations. (SE1, DP3, ME2, SE4, G2)
    \item The suggestions about interventions are sent to the municipality to evaluate a possible solution.
    \item Traffic data is stored and available for public consultation with different levels of visibility, according to user's level of authorization. (SE1, SE2, G3)
    \begin{enumerate}[label={R\arabic{enumi}.\arabic*.}]
    	\item The system allows a normal user to access only to aggregated data, without the license plate of the reported vehicle or the personal info of the user who reported the violation.
    	\item The system allows the authorities to access the data without any limitation.
    \end{enumerate}
	\item A human[TODO] must ascertain the identity of authorities that want to register to the system.
	\item The system receives reports about the various traffic violations from the users.
	\item A violation report must have a photo attached that clearly shows the license plate and the type of violation. 
\end{enumerate}
