The SafeStreets service is offered to common users to report traffic violations that hinder the normal flow of the traffic. It is thought to offer an aide to the public officers in detecting violations and thus provide a more regulated traffic system to the citizens. The service stands in the middle between the common citizen and the authorities, providing a real-time update of the situation on the streets.

The software will be distributed in Europe and will provide to any European citizen the possibility to report traffic violations by taking a photo of the transgressor's vehicle with its license plate visible and an appropriate view of the situation. The system will locate automatically the location of the violation, assuming the device of the user has the GPS service enabled. When the report is received by the system, it's stored into a database and authorities that have jurisdiction over that city can access it to consult its details and validate or invalidate it . The user will be able to track the status of their reports from the mobile app. SafeStreets, besides receiving reports from users, will also provide the possibility to consult its stored data with different levels of authorization for privacy safety reasons. A common citizen will be able to find the most frequent violations by location or time, but no private information of the violations will be provided. Whereas, the registered authorities will be able to perform the same queries and access to all the private information of the transgressors, for example, they will be able to find the most frequent transgressor in a certain area.

To help municipalities in identifying potentially unsafe areas, SafeStreets retrieves data about traffic accidents in their territories from their specific service. It crosses this data with its own stored data and computes possible interventions to areas most affected by violations, for example suggesting to add a barrier between the bike lane and the part of the road for motorized vehicles to prevent unsafe parking.
