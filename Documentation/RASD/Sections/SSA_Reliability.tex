The system must be fault tolerant ot possible server hardware failures or information flooding, so that could constantly provide a quality and responsive service to all customers. To reach this goal servers should be splitted in RACS (Reliable array of cloned services), so that one has problems the others will take care of the requests. This structure also can be exploited to optimize the request work load among the cloned services.
