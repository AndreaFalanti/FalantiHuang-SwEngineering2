The system must be fault tolerant to possible server hardware failures or information flooding, so that it could constantly provide a quality and responsive service to all customers. To reach this goal servers should be split in RACS (Reliable array of cloned services), so that when one has problems the others will take care of the requests. This structure can also be exploited to optimize the request work load among the cloned services.
