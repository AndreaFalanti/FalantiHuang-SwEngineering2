The code used in the application should be written with frameworks that supports multiple platforms. This makes code more portable within platforms, avoiding using native code for each specific operative system and reducing drastically time required to develop the applications and the code to maintain. Native code could also be used for functionalities not covered by the system or for improving critical aspects of the app, but using a common framework for developing all the code should avoid necessity of multiple teams specialized in each platform and discrepancy between the applications.
