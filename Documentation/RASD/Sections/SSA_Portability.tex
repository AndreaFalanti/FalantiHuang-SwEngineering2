The code used in the application should be written with frameworks that supports multiple platforms. This makes code more portable between platforms, avoiding usage of native code for each specific operative system and drastically reducing the time required to develop and maintain the application. Native code could also be used for functionalities not covered by the system or for improving critical aspects of the app, but using a common framework for developing all the code should avoid necessity of multiple teams specialized in each platform and discrepancy between the applications.
