Any user who has a device with internet connection is able to access the services offered by SafeStreets (e.g. reporting violation with images and mining data about the previously reported violations). GPS sensor is required to report a violation.

Official apps supported mobile operating systems are Android (4.4 and above) and iOS (9.0 and above). The website can be accessed with any modern browser with AJAX support.

The additional service of suggesting possible interventions to the most unsafe areas doesn't require the municipality to provide an API to let SafeStreets access its data and augment it with its own for intervention analysis, but it's recommended to improve drastically the results given by the algorithm.

For image recognition and GPS localization services, the system employs external APIs to focus on its main business of providing users the possibility to report traffic violations.

The S2B is assumed to be distributed in Europe; it needs only an email for the registration of common citizens, and a public certified email(PCE) for the authorities. Also it must be compliant with the GDPR normative for the privacy.
