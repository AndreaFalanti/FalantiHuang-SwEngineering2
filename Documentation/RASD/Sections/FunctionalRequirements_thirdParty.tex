\paragraph{Scenarios}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Henry is a member of the local police of the city of Casalpusterlengo, a municipality that has a partnership with SafeStreets. Every month he wants to check the most unsafe areas in the city, so that he could better patrol the city. This could be done by opening the SafeStreets app and selecting "analyze" tab, then selecting the violation density map option and using the previous month as temporal filter.
    
    \item Lucia, a worker of Bergamo's municipality, is interested in studying possible solutions to recurrent parking violations along Via Milano. Bergamo's municipality is regularly registered to SafeStreets system, so she decides to try to check the list of interventions suggested from SafeStreets' algorithm. After she logs in the app, she just needs to check the suggestions tab to search for valid ones in that area, then she can also rate them to improve the suggestion system.
\end{enumerate}
