\paragraph{Scenarios}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Henry is a member of the local police of the city of Casalpusterlengo, a municipality that have a partnership with SafeStreets. Every month he wants to check the most unsafe areas in the city, so that he could better patrol the city. This could be done by opening the SafeStreets app and selecting "analyze" tab, then selecting the violation density map option and using the previous month as temporal filter.
\end{enumerate}
