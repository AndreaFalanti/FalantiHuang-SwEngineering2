Data accessibility needs to be restricted based on the level of authorization of the account in which the customer has logged in and tries to fetch the information.

Citizens' accounts have the lowest level of authorization and can visualize only aggregated data about the violation reports stored in the system. They can't by any means visualize single report for checking info about the report submitter or the vehicle involved, but can visualize violations density based on time, location and type filters.

Municipalities' accounts can perform all actions allowed to citizens, plus they can check and analyze interventions suggested by the system to resolve the detected problems that could have caused the violations in their competence area.

Authorities' accounts can perform all actions allowed to citizens too, but can also analyze individual violation reports in their competence area, accessing also sensible data like the license plate of the vehicle involved and the account who submitted the report, and have the possibility to validate or invalidate them.
