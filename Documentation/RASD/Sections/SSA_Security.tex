Violation reports don't contain sensitive data, but it's really important to provide proper encryption and security measures to avoid leaking the identity of the report submitter, as it could expose the users to possible repercussions. License plate info must be also omitted from aggregated report data visualizations for citizens, to  avoid possible social issues. Complete access to this info must be granted only to authorities and it's really important to properly test the program to avoid information leaking from accounts with less privileges.
