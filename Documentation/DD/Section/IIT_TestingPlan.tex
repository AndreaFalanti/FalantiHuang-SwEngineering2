During the implementation, the system's components must be progressively tested and integrated together, but first of all each component must be unit tested, so that it's possible to recognize if a component is bugged or faulty. Integration tests will be performed after unit tests, providing the certainty that the flow of messages through the interfaces and the final output of the operations are consistent with the expected results.

As mentioned before, a small database with fictional data should be implemented in first steps of implementation, so that it's possible to test the component more easily because the data contained in the database and so the output of the operation can be known before execution. It's important that tests revert the operations performed on this test database after the test is completed, otherwise the modification will alter the results of successive runs of test suites.
