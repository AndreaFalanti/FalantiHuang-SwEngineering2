In this section are listed all functionalities discussed in the RASD and DD document, also explaining how they are actually implemented and illustrating eventual relaxations that need to be refined for the final version of the software and also other eventual improvements. Anyway, the prototype covers at least a good part of all the functionalities required by SafeStreets system, providing a showcase of all the services offered by the system and also a very good starting point for implementing the final release.

Because the design document section 4 (Requirement traceability) provided already a map between the requirements and the components of the system, the following sections will focus directly on the server components, explaining how the functionalities are reached.
