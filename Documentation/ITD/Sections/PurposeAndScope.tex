The scope of this document is to provide an overview on how the SafeStreets developed prototype has been made, which technologies have been chosen for its implementation and how testing has been performed. It is also discussed how the prototype matches the requirements described in the "Requirement Analysis and Verification Document" and how the architecture follows the structure defined in the "Design Document".

It's important to say that the prototype is meant to represent a showcase of the system to the actual stakeholders, but it doesn't represent the final version of the software to be. The main focus of the prototype development is in fact to illustrate all functionalities of the service (either in complete or simplified versions), so strict functional testing has been performed on the prototype, while performances have been taken into account but not accurately tested.
