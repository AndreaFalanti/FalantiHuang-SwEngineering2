The testing on the client consists of unit tests on the business logic of the application. In particular, unit tests are performed for the encoding of json objects coming from the server (users, reports, cities) and data manipulation for representation on the charts of the data analysis screen. In the latter case, unit tests are performed to check whether the different kinds of reports grouping are correct.
