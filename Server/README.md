# SafeStreets server

## Overview
The server runs in a node.js environment, using *express* and *oas-tools* as main middleware.

Test suites are handled by *Jest* framework, using *supertest* package for testing API requests to the server itself
and *puppeteer* to test html and javascript files running in the browser.

This server stub was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen)
